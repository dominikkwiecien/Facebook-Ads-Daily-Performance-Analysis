# Facebook Ads Daily Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project presents an analysis of daily performance metrics for Facebook ad campaigns. The objective was to aggregate and calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) from the `facebook_ads_basic_daily` table, focusing on metrics such as cost, impressions, clicks, and conversion value. Additionally, several derived metrics such as CPC, CPM, CTR, and ROMI were calculated to evaluate the efficiency and return on investment of each campaign.

## SQL Query

The following SQL query was used to perform the analysis:

```sql
SELECT
    ad_date,
    campaign_id,
    SUM(spend) AS total_spend,
    SUM(impressions) AS total_impressions,
    SUM(clicks) AS total_clicks,
    SUM(value) AS total_value,
    round(1.0 * SUM(spend) / NULLIF(SUM(clicks), 0), 2) AS "CPC",
    round(1.0 * SUM(spend) / NULLIF(SUM(impressions), 0), 2) * 1000 AS "CPM",
    round(1.0 * SUM(clicks) / NULLIF(SUM(impressions), 0), 2) * 100 AS "CTR",
    round(1.0 * SUM(value) / NULLIF(SUM(spend), 0), 2) * 100 AS "ROMI"
FROM public.facebook_ads_basic_daily
GROUP BY
    ad_date,
    campaign_id
ORDER BY ad_date;
```

### Key Metrics Explained

- **Total Spend (`total_spend`)**: The total amount spent on ads for a given date and campaign.
- **Total Impressions (`total_impressions`)**: The total number of times the ad was shown.
- **Total Clicks (`total_clicks`)**: The total number of clicks the ad received.
- **Total Value (`total_value`)**: The total conversion value generated by the ad.

### Derived KPIs

- **Cost Per Click (CPC)**: Calculated as `total_spend / total_clicks`. It indicates the average cost of each click.
- **Cost Per Mille (CPM)**: Calculated as `(total_spend / total_impressions) * 1000`. It shows the cost of 1,000 ad impressions.
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Calculated as `(total_clicks / total_impressions) * 100`. This metric reflects the percentage of impressions that resulted in a click.
- **Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)**: Calculated as `(total_value / total_spend) * 100`. This metric demonstrates the return generated from each dollar spent on the campaign.

## Project Structure

- **SQL Script**: Contains the SQL query used for data aggregation and KPI calculations.
- **README.md**: This document provides an overview and explanation of the project.
- **Results**: The results from the SQL query, which can be exported to a CSV file or used in further analysis.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of aggregating and analyzing advertising data to monitor and optimize campaign performance. The derived KPIs such as CPC, CPM, CTR, and ROMI provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of ad spending, allowing marketers to make data-driven decisions.
